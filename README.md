Hello! I am a PhD student working on natural language processing, computational social science, and human-centered AI.
I am interested in opportunities to apply my research to problems relating to the access and trustworthiness of knowledge on the web, through applied work in areas like question answering, knowledge representation, information retrieval, and cultural analysis.

You can learn more about me and my interests at jeremiah.milbauer.info.
